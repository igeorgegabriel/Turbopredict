# Extended Analysis System - FULLY DISABLED

## Status: ✅ COMPLETELY DISABLED

All extended analysis plotting has been disabled across the codebase.

## Files Modified:

### 1. **turbopredict.py**
Disabled extended plot generation in 3 locations:
- Line 1180-1183: `_generate_enhanced_plots()` → Commented out (with rich console)
- Line 1231-1234: `_generate_enhanced_plots()` → Commented out (fallback mode)
- Line 1870-1874: `_generate_enhanced_option2_plots()` → Commented out (Option [2])

### 2. **final_anomaly_plots.py**
Standalone script completely disabled:
- Added error message on import
- Script exits immediately with sys.exit(1)
- Provides migration instructions to new system

## What Was Disabled:

### Old System (REMOVED):
- **Files**: `*_SMART_ANALYSIS.png`
- **Directory**: `reports/YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD_Analysis/HH-MM-SS_PlottingTime/`
- **Behavior**: Generated plots for ALL tags regardless of anomaly status
- **Scope**: Historical 90-day analysis
- **Trigger**: Automatic after every analysis run

### New System (ACTIVE):
- **Files**: `ANOMALY_*.png`
- **Directory**: `reports/DD-MM-YYYY/HHAM/`
- **Behavior**: Generates plots ONLY for verified anomalies
- **Scope**: Only recent (<24 hours) CRITICAL/HIGH priority
- **Trigger**: Automatic when anomalies meet strict criteria
- **Bonus**: Automatic PDF compilation of all plots

## How to Use New System:

```bash
python turbopredict.py
# Select Option [2]: ANALYZE ALL UNITS
```

**Automatic plotting occurs when:**
1. ✅ Anomaly detected in last 24 hours (NEW/FRESH)
2. ✅ Priority is CRITICAL or HIGH
3. ✅ Confidence score meets threshold (weighted scoring)
4. ✅ Verified by MTD and/or Isolation Forest
5. ✅ Primary detector confirmed (2.5σ or AutoEncoder)

**Output:**
- Individual PNG files per anomalous tag
- Consolidated PDF report with all anomaly plots
- Summary report with confidence breakdowns

## Verification:

Test that old system is disabled:
```bash
# This should show error message and exit
python final_anomaly_plots.py
```

Expected output:
```
[DISABLED] ERROR: This script has been DISABLED
...migration instructions...
```

## Old Directories:

Existing directories like `reports/2025-07-14_to_2025-10-12_Analysis/` will remain but:
- ❌ No new plots will be generated there
- ❌ System will not create new dated analysis directories
- ✅ New plots go to `reports/DD-MM-YYYY/HHAM/` format only

You can safely delete old analysis directories if desired:
```bash
# Optional cleanup
rm -rf "reports/2025-07-14_to_2025-10-12_Analysis"
```

## Why This Change:

**Problems with old system:**
- Generated dozens of plots even when everything was normal
- Cluttered report directories with redundant plots
- No focus on actionable, recent issues
- Confusing date-range directory naming
- Wasted computation on historical data

**Benefits of new system:**
- Only plots what needs attention
- Clear, focused reports
- Recent anomalies prioritized
- Weighted confidence scoring (smart filtering)
- Single PDF for easy sharing

**Status**: FULLY DISABLED
**Migration**: Complete - Use Option [2] in turbopredict.py
