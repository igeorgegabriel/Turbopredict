# Option [3] Refactored - Continuous Loop

## What Changed

Option [3] has been completely refactored from a complex Windows Scheduled Task Manager to a **simple endless loop** that runs Option [1] → Option [2] repeatedly.

## New Behavior

### Before (Complex):
- Managed Windows Scheduled Tasks
- Required admin permissions
- Multiple sub-menus and configurations
- Difficult to stop/restart
- Complex logs and status tracking

### After (Simple):
- **Press Option [3]** → Starts endless loop
- **Press CTRL+C** → Stops loop
- Runs: **Option [1] (Auto-Refresh) → Option [2] (Deep Analysis) → Repeat**
- Shows cycle count, duration, and total runtime
- Automatic memory cleanup between cycles

## Features

✅ **Simple**: Single key press to start, CTRL+C to stop
✅ **Memory Safe**: Runs `gc.collect()` after each cycle to prevent memory leaks
✅ **Excel Safe**: Each cycle completes fully before starting next
✅ **Error Resilient**: If Option [1] or [2] fails, continues to next cycle
✅ **Tracking**: Shows cycle number, duration, and total runtime
✅ **No Admin**: Runs as current user, no special permissions needed

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode
python turbopredict.py
# Select option [3]
# Press Enter to start
# Press CTRL+C when you want to stop

# Command line mode
python turbopredict.py --hourly-loop
```

## Example Output

```
================================================================================
     CONTINUOUS AUTO-REFRESH LOOP
================================================================================
This will run Option [1] then Option [2] in endless loop
Press CTRL+C to stop

Press Enter to start continuous loop...

================================================================================
     CYCLE #1 - 2025-10-13 12:00:00
================================================================================

>>> STEP 1/2: AUTO-REFRESH SCAN <<<
[Running Option 1...]

>>> STEP 2/2: UNIT DEEP ANALYSIS <<<
[Running Option 2...]

================================================================================
     CYCLE #1 COMPLETE
================================================================================
  Cycle Duration: 245.3s
  Total Runtime: 4.1 minutes
  Total Cycles: 1

  Starting next cycle...

[Repeats endlessly until CTRL+C...]

[STOPPED] Continuous loop stopped by user (CTRL+C)
  Total cycles completed: 5
  Total runtime: 21.3 minutes

Press Enter to return to main menu...
```

## Benefits

1. **No Memory Issues**: Garbage collection after each cycle
2. **No Excel Lock Issues**: Each cycle completes fully before next starts
3. **Easy to Control**: Just press CTRL+C to stop anytime
4. **Clear Progress**: See exactly how many cycles ran and how long
5. **Crash Recovery**: If one option fails, loop continues

## Technical Details

- Uses `gc.collect()` to free memory after each cycle
- 2-second delay between cycles to prevent resource exhaustion
- Full exception handling with detailed error messages
- Maintains cycle counter and total runtime tracking
- Returns to main menu after stopping (doesn't exit program)

## Removed Features

The following complex features were removed:
- ❌ Windows Scheduled Task management
- ❌ Background service installation
- ❌ Task enable/disable/restart options
- ❌ Log file viewing interface
- ❌ Auto-start on boot configuration

These features were overly complex and are replaced by the simple endless loop pattern.
