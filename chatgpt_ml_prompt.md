# ChatGPT Prompt for Industrial ML Implementation

## Complete Prompt to Send to ChatGPT:

```
I need a comprehensive Python machine learning system for industrial process monitoring with the following requirements:

**DATA STRUCTURE:**
- 12 industrial units: K-12-01, K-16-01, K-19-01, K-31-01, C-02001, C-104, C-201, C-202, C-1301, C-1302, C-13001, 07-MT01-K001, XT-07002
- Data format: Parquet files with columns ['plant', 'unit', 'tag', 'time', 'value']
- Each unit has 50-80 PI tags (sensors: FI, TI, PI, PDI, HC, PC, SI, SV, VI, ZI)
- Time series data with 0.1 hour intervals over 1-1.5 years
- Files located in: data/processed/{unit}_1y_0p1h.parquet

**MACHINE LEARNING REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Baseline Model Training:**
   - Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and DBSCAN clustering
   - Statistical baselines (mean, std, quartiles) for each tag
   - Normal behavior pattern recognition
   - Trend analysis and seasonality detection

2. **Predictive Models:**
   - Time series forecasting for critical tags
   - Multi-step ahead prediction (1-hour, 6-hour, 24-hour)
   - Feature engineering with lagged values and rolling statistics
   - Model validation with proper train/test splits

3. **Training Data Generation:**
   - Synthetic anomaly injection for supervised learning
   - Balanced datasets for classification tasks
   - Time series datasets for forecasting
   - Feature engineering pipelines

4. **Model Performance:**
   - Cross-validation strategies for time series
   - Performance metrics (MSE, MAE, F1-score, AUC)
   - Model interpretability and feature importance
   - Automated hyperparameter tuning

**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:**
- Use scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and optionally xgboost/lightgbm
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets (50,000+ rows per unit)
- Robust error handling for missing data and outliers
- Scalable architecture to handle all 12 units automatically
- Export trained models using joblib or pickle
- Generate comprehensive training reports

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Complete Python script with all ML functionality
2. Individual unit training capability
3. Batch processing for all units
4. Model persistence and loading functions
5. Performance evaluation and visualization
6. Training dataset export for external use

**INDUSTRY CONTEXT:**
This is for industrial process monitoring where:
- Speed compensation is critical (PCM.{unit}.020SI6601.PV tags)
- Anomaly detection helps prevent equipment failures
- Predictive maintenance requires forecasting capabilities
- Historical patterns inform operational decisions

Please provide a complete, production-ready Python implementation that can train ML models across all 12 industrial units, with proper data handling, model validation, and export capabilities.
